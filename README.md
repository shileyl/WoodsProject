Woods Simulation Game:

The woods simulation project is a game where multiple players are stranded in a forest and they canâ€™t see or hear each other until they end up in the same cell of the grid. The game simulates random movements of each player until they end up finding each other in the forest. The purpose of the game is to teach K-8 grade students learn about computation, computational thinking, math concepts and computer science. There are 3 different versions of the game K-2, 3-5, and 6-8.
