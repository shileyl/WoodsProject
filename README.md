Woods Simulation Game:

The woods simulation project is a graphical game where multiple players are stranded in a forest and they canâ€™t see or hear each other until they end up in the same cell of the grid. The game simulates random movements of each player until they end up finding each other in the forest. The purpose of the game is to teach K-8 grade students learn about computation, computational thinking, math concepts and computer science. There are 3 different versions of the game K-2, 3-5, and 6-8. 

Grades K-2: the grids are always square, there are always two people, and they start out in diagonally opposite corners of the grid. They wander about randomly, and each move is counted, with a counter for each person. When the people bump into each other the game will end and display statistics from the game.

Grades 3-5: students can set up the size of a grid, which can be rectangular (instead of just square). There can be 2, 3, or 4 people, and students can place them wherever on their grid. Once the game is started, it can be played and replayed multiple times. Statistics (such as longest run without meeting, shortest run, and average run) are displayed. 

Grades 6-8: students have all the control of the 3-5 game, but 6-8 students will be challenged to run experiments to determine how the average run varies with the size and shape of the grids. They will also be able to explore different protocols for wandering, and to decide which is the best way to wander if you want to shorten the time it takes to meet up.
